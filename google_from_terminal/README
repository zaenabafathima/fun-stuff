Uninspired backstory: I was bored and wanted to add something to this repo

This is a short script which displays the top 10 Google search results for a query
and opens the first one in Chrome.

For some theatre, you can create an alias in zshrc like so:
alias google = 'f() {  python3 ~/path/to/file/google_search.py $1 };f'
to do something like:
> google 'royal baby'
which is kinda cool.
